## 1.2. Solution Profile

The objective of Birdz Application is to offer a complete service to all the roles in the business. For example, the suppliers, clients, workers, and administrators. It's important to mention that it also attends to the storage necessity, like notifications when the supplies are almost empty.

### 1.2.1 Problem and Background

To compete with our competitors, we have to recognize our background and problem to solve.

**Background**

In the input industry, it is essential to have efficient organization, communication, and operations to satisfy the client. In recent years, we have noticed the significant evolution of the industry and customer expectations, influenced by technology and the fast expansion of the market or industry.

The great presence of online booking platforms and the constantly growing demand for personalized experiences have created a competitive environment for hotels of every status. Clients not only expect simple service; they expect high service with all the amenities, benefits, and without any setbacks.

Additionally, there is a lack of suitable tools.

**Problem Topic**

We are going to recognize our problem topic by the 5W and 2H method.

**What**

Birdz App is a robust and complete software that improves organization, communication, operations, and real-time decisions for the company workers, attending to the necessities of the workers, clients, admins, and suppliers. Some of the features that Birdz App has are:
- Software Segment for Suppliers
- Software Segment for Workers

- Software Segment for Admins

**Who**

Restaurants all over the world face problems related to organization and lack of client interest. This software is for restaurants that want to have a better tool to improve organization, operations, communication, and real-time decisions.

**When**

The problem topic arises when the restaurant's organization is poor or regular, and clients are dissatisfied with the bad service from the restaurant. In that case, it is necessary to have good software to optimize speed and organization.

**Where**

The necessity of all these features is present in all restaurants. The significant advantage of speed, organization, and operations over other restaurants is indisputable.

**Why**

Inefficient management/organization can worsen the economy, communication, environment, etc. Consequently, it leads to an unsatisfactory experience for the client.

**How much**

At the beginning of the subscription model, each company that wants the software must pay the service's cost.

### 1.2.2 Lean UX Process
The Lean UX process addresses the business model vision that supports our project, with our main product being the software. Throughout this document and in this chapter, we explore several key elements of this process.

We start with the "Problem Statements," which cover aspects such as the domain, customer segments, pain points, gaps, vision/strategy, and the initial segment. Following the Lean UX methodology, we also consider the "Assumptions Statements" and the "Hypothesis Statements."

### 1.2.2.1 Lean UX Problem Statements
**Problem Statement:**
Efficient restaurant management presents significant challenges, including the lack of integrated tools that address all business facets. Owners and managers face difficulties in effectively managing income, inventory, suppliers, and human resources, which can result in revenue loss, resource waste, and unsatisfactory customer experiences.

**Domain:**
We focus on the restaurant industry. We recognize the diversity and complexity of this sector, which ranges from small family-owned restaurants to large chains, each with its unique needs and operational management challenges.

**Customer Segments:**
We target the owners and managers of Birdz, as well as its staff, administrators, and suppliers. We understand that restaurant management encompasses a wide range of establishments, and our platform is designed to adapt to the needs of all these segments.

**Pain Points:**

- **Difficulty in accurately tracking restaurant income and expenses:** The lack of adequate tools hinders effective monitoring of financial flows, which can lead to incorrect decisions and lost revenue.
- **Challenges in inventory management and supplier relationships:** Coordinating inventory and communication with suppliers can be complicated and time-consuming, resulting in supply shortages or overstock.
- **Complexities in managing staff and human resources:** Scheduling shifts, tracking attendance, performance evaluations, and payroll management are just some of the laborious tasks restaurant managers face in managing their staff.

**Vision/Strategy:**

Our vision is to provide an all-in-one, easy-to-use solution that addresses all the management needs of a restaurant, from finances to human resources. We strive to improve operational efficiency and customer experience by offering a centralized platform that simplifies and optimizes all operations related to restaurant management.

**Initial Segment:**

We initially focus on independent restaurants and small restaurant chains that seek accessible and efficient solutions to optimize their operations. We recognize the importance of providing affordable and adaptable tools for these segments, which often lack the resources of large chains but have an urgent need to improve their efficiency and competitiveness in the market.

## 4.2. Information Architecture.
The information architecture employed in Birdz Management System will enable restaurant owners to organize processes within their establishment. It provides tracking of income, suppliers, inventory, and resources within the restaurant, all aimed at facilitating internal management of the restaurant.

### 4.2.1. Organization Systems.

These are the organizational systems to follow.

**Visual Organization of Content**  
A hierarchical visual organization of content will be developed on the Landing Page and the main sections of the website to highlight important information, such as resource management, inventory, and updated supplier information.

**Content Categorization**  
- **Supplier List:** Organized alphabetically by company name for quick and efficient location of suppliers.  
- **Supplies:** A list of supplies will be created with inventory control to monitor the company's needs.  
- **Resources:** Tracking of resources to better manage finances within the restaurant.

### 4.2.2. Labeling Systems.

These are the labeling systems to follow.

**Clarity and Simplicity:** Use straightforward terms that are easy for users to understand, avoiding complex language that could be confusing. Some technical terms related to restaurant supplies may be used where necessary.

**Brevity:** Use the minimum number of words to simplify user navigation.

**Illustrative Images:** Use images that assist users in locating options and understanding features.

**Use of Icons and Symbols:** Utilize icons to help users recognize functions easily. This is primarily applied in the toolbar.


### 4.2.3. SEO Tags and Meta Tags

### 4.2.4. Searching Systems.

Here we explain the search systems that will be implemented in our project.

On the main page, a general search option will be included, allowing users to access all the content of the application.

An advanced search feature will be implemented in the suppliers and inventory sections, enabling more specific searches by category.

### 4.2.5. Navigation Systems.

This is the navigation system that the user will use during their interaction with the project.

The user will be welcomed with a screen to register their restaurant.

After the user logs in, a toolbar will appear at the bottom of the application, allowing them to navigate the entire application effectively.

You can move around and navigate the dashboard where you can view your profile, see restaurant details, access inventory control, visit the supplier management page, and view the customer management page. Each page will have different options depending on its purpose.

## 4.5. Web Applications Prototyping.

Para crear los modelos de la interfaz de usuario, se aplicaron una serie de principios importante:
Consistencia en el Diseño: Se mantuvo una coherencia visual en todo el diseño de la interfaz de usuario, utilizando un estilo y una paleta de colores uniformes. Esto ayuda a crear una experiencia unificada y familiar para los usuarios, facilitando la navegación y la comprensión de la aplicación.
Destacar la Información Importante: Se enfocó en mostrar únicamente la información más relevante para los usuarios del segmento objetivo, evitando la saturación de información innecesaria.
Facilidad de Uso y Claridad: Se buscó que la navegación en la aplicación fuera intuitiva y comprensible, de manera que los usuarios puedan entender completamente cómo utilizar las funciones de la aplicación, como en la visualización de reportes estadísticos.

## 1.2. Solution Profile

The objective of Birdz Application is to offer a complete service to all the roles in the business. For example, the suppliers, clients, workers, and administrators. It's important to mention that it also attends to the storage necessity, like notifications when the supplies are almost empty.

### 1.2.1 Problem and Background

To compete with our competitors, we have to recognize our background and problem to solve.

**Background**

In the input industry, it is essential to have efficient organization, communication, and operations to satisfy the client. In recent years, we have noticed the significant evolution of the industry and customer expectations, influenced by technology and the fast expansion of the market or industry.

The great presence of online booking platforms and the constantly growing demand for personalized experiences have created a competitive environment for hotels of every status. Clients not only expect simple service; they expect high service with all the amenities, benefits, and without any setbacks.

Additionally, there is a lack of suitable tools.

**Problem Topic**

We are going to recognize our problem topic by the 5W and 2H method.

**What**

Birdz App is a robust and complete software that improves organization, communication, operations, and real-time decisions for the company workers, attending to the necessities of the workers, clients, admins, and suppliers. Some of the features that Birdz App has are:
- Software Segment for Suppliers
- Software Segment for Workers

- Software Segment for Admins

**Who**

Restaurants all over the world face problems related to organization and lack of client interest. This software is for restaurants that want to have a better tool to improve organization, operations, communication, and real-time decisions.

**When**

The problem topic arises when the restaurant's organization is poor or regular, and clients are dissatisfied with the bad service from the restaurant. In that case, it is necessary to have good software to optimize speed and organization.

**Where**

The necessity of all these features is present in all restaurants. The significant advantage of speed, organization, and operations over other restaurants is indisputable.

**Why**

Inefficient management/organization can worsen the economy, communication, environment, etc. Consequently, it leads to an unsatisfactory experience for the client.

**How much**

At the beginning of the subscription model, each company that wants the software must pay the service's cost.

### 1.2.2 Lean UX Process
The Lean UX process addresses the business model vision that supports our project, with our main product being the software. Throughout this document and in this chapter, we explore several key elements of this process.

We start with the "Problem Statements," which cover aspects such as the domain, customer segments, pain points, gaps, vision/strategy, and the initial segment. Following the Lean UX methodology, we also consider the "Assumptions Statements" and the "Hypothesis Statements."

### 1.2.2.1 Lean UX Problem Statements
**Problem Statement:**
Efficient restaurant management presents significant challenges, including the lack of integrated tools that address all business facets. Owners and managers face difficulties in effectively managing income, inventory, suppliers, and human resources, which can result in revenue loss, resource waste, and unsatisfactory customer experiences.

**Domain:**
We focus on the restaurant industry. We recognize the diversity and complexity of this sector, which ranges from small family-owned restaurants to large chains, each with its unique needs and operational management challenges.

**Customer Segments:**
We target the owners and managers of Birdz, as well as its staff, administrators, and suppliers. We understand that restaurant management encompasses a wide range of establishments, and our platform is designed to adapt to the needs of all these segments.

**Pain Points:**

- **Difficulty in accurately tracking restaurant income and expenses:** The lack of adequate tools hinders effective monitoring of financial flows, which can lead to incorrect decisions and lost revenue.
- **Challenges in inventory management and supplier relationships:** Coordinating inventory and communication with suppliers can be complicated and time-consuming, resulting in supply shortages or overstock.
- **Complexities in managing staff and human resources:** Scheduling shifts, tracking attendance, performance evaluations, and payroll management are just some of the laborious tasks restaurant managers face in managing their staff.

**Vision/Strategy:**

Our vision is to provide an all-in-one, easy-to-use solution that addresses all the management needs of a restaurant, from finances to human resources. We strive to improve operational efficiency and customer experience by offering a centralized platform that simplifies and optimizes all operations related to restaurant management.

**Initial Segment:**

We initially focus on independent restaurants and small restaurant chains that seek accessible and efficient solutions to optimize their operations. We recognize the importance of providing affordable and adaptable tools for these segments, which often lack the resources of large chains but have an urgent need to improve their efficiency and competitiveness in the market.

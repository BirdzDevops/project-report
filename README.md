The objective of Birdz Application is to offer a complete service to all the roles in the business. For example, the suppliers, clients, workers, and administrators. It's important to mention that it also attends to the storage necessity, like notifications when the supplies are almost empty.

### 1.2.1 Antecedentes y problemática

To compete with our competitors, we have to recognize our background and problem to solve.

**Background**

In the input industry, it is essential to have efficient organization, communication, and operations to satisfy the client. In recent years, we have noticed the significant evolution of the industry and customer expectations, influenced by technology and the fast expansion of the market or industry.

The great presence of online booking platforms and the constantly growing demand for personalized experiences have created a competitive environment for hotels of every status. Clients not only expect simple service; they expect high service with all the amenities, benefits, and without any setbacks.

Additionally, there is a lack of suitable tools.

**Problem Topic**

We are going to recognize our problem topic by the 5W and 2H method.

**What**

Birdz App is a robust and complete software that improves organization, communication, operations, and real-time decisions for the company workers, attending to the necessities of the workers, clients, admins, and suppliers. Some of the features that Birdz App has are:
- Software Segment for Suppliers
- Software Segment for Workers
- Software Segment for Clients
- Software Segment for Admins

**Who**

Restaurants all over the world face problems related to organization and lack of client interest. This software is for restaurants that want to have a better tool to improve organization, operations, communication, and real-time decisions.

**When**

The problem topic arises when the restaurant's organization is poor or regular, and clients are dissatisfied with the bad service from the restaurant. In that case, it is necessary to have good software to optimize speed and organization.

**Where**

The necessity of all these features is present in all restaurants. The significant advantage of speed, organization, and operations over other restaurants is indisputable.

**Why**

Inefficient management/organization can worsen the economy, communication, environment, etc. Consequently, it leads to an unsatisfactory experience for the client. 

**How**

Birdz App addresses this problem by providing a complete platform that pledges an intuitive UI and a comprehensive list of operations, segments, etc. In this way, the business will be easier to manage.

**How much**

At the beginning of the subscription model, each company that wants the software must pay the service's cost.

### 1.2.2 Lean UX Process
The Lean UX process addresses the business model vision that supports our project, with our main product being the software. Throughout this document and in this chapter, we explore several key elements of this process.

We start with the "Problem Statements," which cover aspects such as the domain, customer segments, pain points, gaps, vision/strategy, and the initial segment. Following the Lean UX methodology, we also consider the "Assumptions Statements" and the "Hypothesis Statements."

### 1.2.2.1 Lean UX Problem Statements
**Problem Statement:**
Efficient restaurant management presents significant challenges, especially for large restaurant chains like Birdz, due to the lack of integrated tools that address all business facets. Managing income, inventory, suppliers, and human resources across multiple locations can result in revenue loss, resource waste, and unsatisfactory customer experiences.

**Domain:**
We focus exclusively on large restaurant chains, specifically Birdz, recognizing the unique needs and operational management challenges inherent to this scale of operation.

**Customer Segments:**
Our primary target is the management teams of large restaurant chains, particularly those overseeing operations at Birdz. These individuals face complex challenges in coordinating and optimizing various aspects of restaurant management across numerous locations.

**Pain Points:**
Difficulty in accurately tracking consolidated restaurant income and expenses across multiple locations: The lack of adequate tools hinders effective monitoring of financial flows, leading to potential mismanagement and revenue loss.
Challenges in managing inventory and supplier relationships across multiple outlets: Coordinating inventory levels and communication with suppliers can be complicated and time-consuming, risking supply shortages or excess stock in certain locations.
Complexities in managing staff and human resources across multiple units: Scheduling shifts, tracking attendance, performance evaluations, and payroll management become increasingly challenging as the chain expands.

**Vision/Strategy:**
Our vision is to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use solution tailored specifically for large restaurant chains like Birdz. We aim to improve operational efficiency and customer experience by offering a centralized platform that simplifies and optimizes all operations related to restaurant management across multiple locations.

**Initial Segment:**
We initially focus on Birdz, recognizing the importance of offering specialized and scalable tools for large chains that often face unique challenges in managing their operations efficiently and competitively in the market.
